no , it was n't black monday .
but while the new york stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the dow jones industrial average plunged <unk> points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos .
some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the october 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures .
the 49 stock specialist firms on the big board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure .
big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock , traders say .
heavy selling of standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures in chicago <unk> beat stocks downward .
seven big board stocks -- ual , amr , bankamerica , walt disney , capital cities/abc , philip morris and pacific telesis group -- stopped trading and never resumed .
the <unk> has already begun .
`` the equity market was <unk> .
once again -lcb- the specialists -rcb- were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the new york stock exchange , '' said christopher <unk> , senior vice president at <unk> securities corp .
<unk> james <unk> , chairman of specialists henderson brothers inc. : `` it is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job .
when the dollar is in a <unk> , even central banks ca n't stop it .
speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market . ''
many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day -- because the stock market was so quiet .
then in a <unk> plunge , the dow jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year , <unk> up a 190.58-point , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in <unk> trading volume .
<unk> trading accelerated to <unk> million shares , a record for the big board .
at the end of the day , <unk> million shares were traded .
the dow jones industrials closed at <unk> .
the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <unk> black monday crash that occurred oct. 19 , 1987 .
in percentage terms , however , the dow 's dive was the <unk> ever and the <unk> since the market fell <unk> , or 8 % , a week after black monday .
the dow fell <unk> % on black monday .
shares of ual , the parent of united airlines , were extremely active all day friday , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ 6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an <unk> group .
wall street 's takeover-stock speculators , or `` risk arbitragers , '' had placed unusually large <unk> that a takeover would succeed and ual stock would rise .
at <unk> p.m. edt , came the <unk> news : the big board was <unk> trading in ual , `` pending news . ''
on the exchange floor , `` as soon as ual stopped trading , we <unk> for a panic , '' said one top floor trader .
several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news <unk> .
for weeks , the market had been nervous about takeovers , after campeau corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers .
and 10 minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid .
at this point , the dow was down about 35 points .
the market <unk> .
arbitragers could n't dump their ual stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had .
for example , their selling caused trading <unk> to be declared in usair group , which closed down 3 7/8 to 41 1/2 , delta air lines , which fell 7 3/4 to 69 1/4 , and <unk> industries , which sank 3 to 21 1/2 .
these stocks eventually reopened .
but as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses .
when trading was halted in philip morris , the stock was trading at 41 , down 3 3/8 , while ibm closed 5 5/8 lower at 102 .
selling <unk> because of waves of automatic `` stop-loss '' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels .
most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals , including computer-guided program traders .
traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight .
now , at <unk> , one of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the s&p 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a <unk> drop in the dow industrials .
under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange , trading was temporarily halted in chicago .
after the trading halt in the s&p 500 pit in chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board , and specialists continued to <unk> prices down .
as a result , the link between the futures and stock markets <unk> apart .
without the <unk> of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board .
the futures halt was even <unk> by big board floor traders .
`` it <unk> things up , '' said one major specialist .
this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings .
-lrb- in a stock-index arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . -rrb-
`` when the airline information came through , it <unk> every model we had for the marketplace , '' said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms .
`` we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . ''
but stocks kept falling .
the dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the <unk> halt .
at <unk> p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down <unk> points .
meanwhile , during the the s&p trading halt , s&p futures sell orders began <unk> up , while stocks in new york kept falling sharply .
big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker `` worked well <unk> .
i just think it 's <unk> at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . ''
under another post-crash system , big board president richard <unk> -lrb- mr. phelan was flying to <unk> as the market was falling -rrb- was talking on an `` <unk> hot line '' to the other exchanges , the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board .
he <unk> out at a high-tech <unk> center on the floor of the big board , where he could watch <unk> on prices and pending stock orders .
at about <unk> p.m. edt , s&p futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line .
buyers stepped in to the futures pit .
but the <unk> of s&p futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .
at about <unk> , the s&p market <unk> to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again .
futures traders say the s&p was <unk> that the dow could fall as much as 200 points .
during this time , small investors began ringing their brokers , wondering whether another crash had begun .
at prudential-bache securities inc. , which is trying to cater to small investors , some <unk> brokers thought this would be the final <unk> .
that 's when george l. ball , chairman of the prudential insurance co. of america unit , took to the internal <unk> system to declare that the plunge was only `` mechanical . ''
`` i have a <unk> that this particular decline today is something ` more <unk> about less . '
it would be my <unk> to advise clients not to sell , to look for an opportunity to buy , '' mr. ball told the brokers .
at merrill lynch & co. , the nation 's biggest brokerage firm , a news release was prepared <unk> `` merrill lynch comments on market drop . ''
the release cautioned that `` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of october 1987 '' and that there are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock market .
however , jeffrey b. lane , president of shearson lehman hutton inc. , said that friday 's plunge is `` going to set back '' relations with customers , `` because it <unk> the concern of volatility .
and i think a lot of people will <unk> on program trading .
it 's going to bring the debate right back to the <unk> . ''
as the dow average ground to its final <unk> loss friday , the s&p pit stayed locked at its <unk> trading limit .
jeffrey <unk> of program trader <unk> investment group said 2,000 s&p contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of $ <unk> million in stock .
but there were no buyers .
while friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said .
stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself .
at those levels , stocks are set up to be <unk> by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks .
but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today .
the <unk> between the stock and futures markets friday will <unk> cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation .
the big board 's mr. <unk> said , `` our <unk> performance was good . ''
but the exchange will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks .
obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <unk> obligations were n't met , '' he said .

but specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash , the `` <unk> '' firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during friday 's <unk> .
mr. phelan said , `` it will take another day or two '' to analyze who was buying and selling friday .
concerning your sept. 21 page-one article on prince charles and the <unk> : it 's a few hundred years since england has been a kingdom .
